# HTML and CSS Clone - The Next Web Homepage

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design)

This project is a clone of [The Next Web homepage](https://thenextweb.com/) using HTML, SASS, Bootstrap 4 and Font Awesome. The SASS is written using BEM with PascalCasing, as recommended in the [Airbnb CSS / SASS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css).

The SASS is written using partials to create separate modules for each section and imported into `main.scss` to be compiled into CSS. The project uses Bootstrap to provide an opinionated CSS reset and for utility classes like `container`. The icons are provided by Font Awesome.
